# Project Design Collaboration Index 
This project is meant for teams to give better peer review to encourage self-improvement through data visualisation. It's for the Introduction to Design Thinking module (3.007) as one of the modules in the undergraduate Freshmore Curriculum in SUTD. More details about this can be found [here](https://smt.sutd.edu.sg/education/undergraduate/courses/03007-introduction-design).

Initially, peer review for this module was done by TEAMMATES twice by each inidividual. However, peer review was often not very reflective of the teammates feedback.
